# Lane-and-Vehicle-detection
> A single-pass pipeline to perform lane and vehicle detection using an improved LLDNet network and a YOLO network transferred learnt on real road datasets. Main contribution is the single-pass inference capability at reduced model size and comparable model accuracies to larger, slower, and single-purpose networks.
